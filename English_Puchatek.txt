One day, when Pooh had nothing to do, he felt that he would like to go and see Rabbit.
Rabbit lived in a burrow under the ground, and when Pooh got there, he squeezed through the narrow entrance and began looking around the room.
"Hallo, Rabbit!" said Pooh.
"Hallo, Pooh!" said Rabbit. "How are you?"
"I’m just having a rest," said Pooh, "but I don’t mind if I eat something."
Rabbit, being very hospitable, brought out a pot of honey, and Pooh began eating. He ate and ate, until at last there was no more.
"Could I have a little more?" asked Pooh.
"Why, certainly," said Rabbit, and brought another pot of honey.
Pooh ate it all, and then he licked his lips.
"That was the last piece," said Pooh, and tried to get up.
But just as he got to the entrance, something happened. Pooh got stuck!
